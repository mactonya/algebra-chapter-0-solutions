\chapter{Prologue}
Over a few months I want to improve my skills in solving algebra problems. I tried to find a textbook that can serves me good and is good enough to use in self-study. 

Eventually, this is what I felt the most "comfortable" book in my opinion. It doesn't contain that much unlike Dummit \& Foote, but the writing style, the explanation, and the exercises really served me well.

So here is the solution to Algebra : Chapter 0. There are a few important points to note here:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The solution is \emph{only} hosted on my GitHub page \href{https://github.com/macyayaya/algebra-chapter-0-solutions}{https://github.com/macyayaya/algebra-chapter-0-solutions}. If you find this document outside this page, you might have an outdated version of the solution which might have errors, so please be aware.
    \item I will update the solution irregularly.
    \item If you found an error in the solutions, or want to give an advise on LaTeX formatting, etc., don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request on my repo. 
    \item The questions I picked is completely random, so if you want to see some solution of a certain problem (but please not all of them), you can also open an issue to notify me. 
    \item However, I currently do \emph{not} accept any PRs to new solutions; this is more than my note on self-study rather than a complete solution set.
\end{itemize}

Thanks.
