The solution to Algebra : Chapter 0 by Paolo Aluffi. 

**To download the solution, go to https://github.com/macyayaya/algebra-chapter-0-solutions/releases**.

Here is the (unoffical) solution to Algebra : Chapter 0. There are a few important points to note here:
* The solution is only hosted on my GitHub page https://github.com/macyayaya/algebra-chapter-0-solutions. If you find this document outside this page, you might have an outdated version of the solution which might have errors, so please be aware.
* I will update the solution irregularly.
* I'll try to write this beginner-friendly (as I am also a beginner), so the answer might be way too detailed/verbose. Sorry if you find this annoying. 
* If you found an error in the solutions, or want to give an advise on LaTeX formatting, etc., don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request on my repo. 
* The questions I picked is completely random, so if you want to see some solution of a certain problem (but please not all of them), you can also open an issue to notify me. 
 * However, I currently do not accept any PRs to new solutions; this is more than my note on self-study rather than a complete solution set.

Thanks.
