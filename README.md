Here is the (unoffical) solution to Algebra : Chapter 0. There are a few important points to note here:
* The solution is only hosted on my GitHub page https://github.com/mactonya/algebra-chapter-0-solutions. If you find this document outside this page, you might have an outdated version of the solution which might have errors, so please be aware.
* I will update the solution irregularly.
* I'll try to write this beginner-friendly (as I am also a beginner), so the answer might be way too detailed/verbose. Sorry if you find this annoying. 
* If you found an error in the solutions, or want to give an advise on LaTeX formatting, etc., don't hesitate to open an issue or a pull request on my repo. 
* **PRs to new solutions are now open.** You are free to write solutions for this document now. When writing a solution, be sure to make it very beginner friendly: you should make all logics, the use of theorems and the idea very clear. You are also very welcome to refine the proofs if they are unclear.
